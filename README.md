When a Project is added to a Portfolio, the location of the Project is displayed as a marker on a map, to demonstrate where a user's work is concentrated.
Projects within a Portfolio are listed with brief details, however clicking into individual Projects allows display of detailed information, including a display of images related to the Project.
